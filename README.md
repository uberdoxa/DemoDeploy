## Clone The Repo

- In your terminal, navigate to your code folder and ```cd```git into it. **DO NOT CD INTO YOUR WDI FOLDER!**
- Once inside your code folder (**NOT WDI**), type ``git clone`` and then paste the SSH code you copied from github. Hit Enter.
- In your terminal, type ```ls``` and make sure the DemoDeploy folder is listed, then ```cd``` into it.
- Once inside your DemoDeploy folder, you should see that you are on the master branch and all the files from the cloned repo are inside the folder due to the magic of the internet.
- Celebrate!

## Tell GitHub Your gitHub Pages Source

GitHub lets you choose which branch hosts your gitHub pages. We're going to set our source to the master branch.

- Go back to your github account in the Browser and enter your DemoDeploy repo.
- Inside the DemoDeploy repo, click **Settings** from the top menu tabs on the right.
- You are now automatically located in the **Options** part of Settings (you can see the side menu to the left). Scroll down the page until you come the section titled, **gitHub Pages**.
- From the **Source** dropdown, choose the master branch option and hit **save**.
- Celebrate!

## Let's Update our Pages

- Go back to your terminal. Make sure your file path is still inside your code/DemoDeploy folder.
- Type subl . to open your files (or whatever the command is for your text editor).
- Update your index.html by putting your name in the ```title``` tag. Save, add, commit, and push to origin master.
- Return to the browser window -- the gitHub settings page should still be there. Refresh the page.
- Scroll back to the the  **gitHub Pages** section and look for a green bar at the top of the section that says, "Your site is published at:....". Click the link, or copy to a new window.
- If you did everything correct, your page will now be visible, with the title of your name.
- Celebrate!

*Don’t worry if it takes a few minutes for the page to show up because there may be a delay up to ten minutes the first time you push the files to GitHub.*
